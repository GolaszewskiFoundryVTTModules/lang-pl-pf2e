# PF2e Polish Localization
### Polish localization of the Pathfinder Second Edition system for the Foundry VTT.
___
> First and foremost, this module would not have been possible without the help of the lovely folk over at the _Pathfinder on Foundry VTT Community and Volunteer Development Server_ and the permission to base it heavily on the [German Localization module](https://github.com/Foundry-VTT-PF2-German/lang-de-pf2e). Thank you!

## Installation
No pre-packed release currently. Module heavily worked on.

If you want to try the translation in its current state, create a `lang-pl-pf2e` folder in your modules, and then drop the `translation`, `static`, `src` and `fonts` folders along with the `PF2PLAdjustments.css` and `module.json` and you should be good to go. 

## Coverage
Currently the module covers all the core system UI and nomenclature.

The compendium data and rule elements are being translated by-demand based on my private campaign needs and will probably remain semi-translated for quite a while still. (Steady does it...)

## Localization Notice
The translation a personal project. I am in no way affiliated with Paizo nor with the developers of the Foundry VTT or the PF2 system adaptation.  While I try to remain as faithful to the original texts, the areas of gray are filled by my personal decisions and styling preferences.

This includes me taking the liberty to editorialize some outdated pre-remaster content where it still lingers (removing the mention of alignments or schools of magic) and to clear up some questionable wordings here and there to the best of my understanding of the rules - for the ease of Game Mastering my games and for the sake of my players.
