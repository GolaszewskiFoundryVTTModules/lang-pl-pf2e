Stone is often thought to be steadfast and unchanging, but, when viewed on a grander scale over vast periods of time, stone can transform into things as diverse as intricate crystals and fine powder. To the aeolaeka, anything that could become either sand or diamond is the very incarnation of the chaos of reality-just on a slower scale. As a result of their stone affinity, aeolaekas are less capricious than other azatas, and some have willingly forged lasting accords or agreements with mortals. Stone-skinned aeolaekas are sometimes mistaken for statues and use this fact to hide in plain sight when they don't want their presence known.</p>",

Bulette pairs share territory and mate for life-a mated pair of bulettes being the only known exception to the creature's penchant for solitude. They rear their young for a short period of time. The mated pair instruct the young bulette how to hunt, teaching their spawn which creatures are easiest to kill and which creatures to avoid. The mated pair drive off their young after its first successful hunt.</p><p>The first bulettes were magically created guardians, intended to serve as frightening pets for a power-hungry and sadistic wizard. The technique for their creation, as well as their original purpose, has since been lost to history, and multiple conflicting accounts of ancient texts exist with dozens of wizards claiming to have been the first inventor of the notorious beast. Some sages postulate that the original inventor may have been an elf-a theory born out of little more than the curious fact that bulettes, for all their ravenous nature, seem to find elf flesh unpalatable. Unfortunately for elves who stumble into a bulette's path, bulettes are no less likely to kill them than any other intruder, simply leaving the bodies unconsumed where they fall.</p>",

These tresses and full skirts in fact disguise the huldra's supernatural features: a hollow wooden back, a long bovine tail, and incredible strength.</p><p>Folk legends from the lands of the north describe huldras as the creations of troll witches, intended to lure potential meals to the slaughter. Indeed, a huldra's regeneration is so similar to a troll's that a link between the two creatures seems entirely possible, but huldras despise trolls and resent tales suggesting any connection between them. Rather, huldras are wardens of the woodlands they occupy. Grown from saplings by powerful forest-dwelling fey as a response to humanoid encroachment, huldras protect and parley for the forest itself. Woodland creatures adore huldras, and sometimes approach humans or elves thinking they're huldras. This illusion is shattered if the animal sees the humanoid's back is made of flesh or that they're lacking a tail, at which point the animal recoils and runs away.</p><p>Huldras respond well to travelers who show respect and deference for the forest, bestowing those they favor with supernatural luck and fortune. Those who scorn or attack a huldra, or those who mock their distinctive, bovine tails, find themselves plagued by poor decisions and even worse luck. Huldras commonly carry a bad reputation as sirens of the deep forest-cunning monsters who seek to lure woodcutters and unwary adventurers to uncertain ends. These stories largely come from miscreants foolish enough to have treated a huldra rudely and later complain about how they were unjustly persecuted. Even woodcutters and hunters can stay in the good graces of huldras provided they plant few trees to replace what they've taken and don't kill any creatures they don't eat.</p><p>Though huldras choose to appear unassuming, the attention they put into disguising the supernatural parts of their bodies is sometimes lacking when it comes to their strength. They often perform feats of strength, like bending horseshoes straight or lifting heavy objects, without realizing they're breaking their carefully crafted facade.</p>",

A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless it is transported while it hides within its coffin, nor can it enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions-a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome its compulsion just as it does its revulsion.</li><li><strong>Revulsion</strong> A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of its revulsion, it gains the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Uciekający} condition, running from the object of its revulsion until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a vampire can attempt a @Check[will|dc:25|name:Overcome Revulsion] save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for [[/gmr 1d6 #rounds]]{1k6 rounds} (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li><li><strong>Stake</strong> A wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents it from healing above 0 HP, even in its coffin. Staking a vampire requires three actions and works only if the vampire is unconscious. If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if it's in its coffin the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire's head is severed and anointed with <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.z9T4c1hXwOotsMCp]{Holy Water}</em> while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed.</li><li><strong>Sunlight</strong> If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Spowolniony 1}. The slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends its turn in sunlight. If the vampire loses all its actions in this way, it is destroyed.

A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless it is transported while it hides within its coffin, nor can it enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions-a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example.

To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of its revulsion, it gains the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Uciekający} condition, running from the object of its revulsion until it ends an action beyond 10 feet.

On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for [[/gmr 1d6 #rounds]]{1k6 rounds} (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li><li><strong>Stake</strong> A wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents it from healing above 0 HP, even in its coffin. Staking a vampire requires three actions and works only if the vampire is unconscious. If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if it's in its coffin the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire's head is severed and anointed with <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.z9T4c1hXwOotsMCp]{Holy Water}</em> while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed.</li><li><strong>Sunlight</strong> If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Spowolniony 1}.

After long years of research and the creation of a special container called a phylactery, a spellcaster takes the final step by imbibing a deadly concoction or casting dreadful incantations that transform them into a lich. While most undertake this drastic plan to continue their work or fulfill some long-term plan, others become liches because they fear death or to fulfill some malevolent purpose, such as long-sworn revenge. Regardless, the result is permanent and carries with it the potential to alter history-both that of those who transform themselves and of the countless mortals that will inevitably suffer as a result of a lich's new power.</p><p>After its metamorphosis, a lich often finds some quiet place to dwell, typically protected by a variety of guardians and traps, for two primary purposes. First, a lich requires solitude in order to plan its elaborate schemes, and second, few mortals (if any) deign to interact with these legendarily corrupt necromancers. One reason begets the other, as the self-imposed isolation of a lich often drives the lich insane, further solidifying its separation from civilization. The longer a lich lives, the more meticulous a planner it becomes, secreting itself within a labyrinth of deadly puzzles, misdirection, and monsters. A lich's servants and guardians are absolutely loyal, either due to their nature (such as constructs or other undead) or as a result of compulsion using powerful magic. Many liches go mad, in time, and the nature of a lich's lair is a good indicator of the undead's current mental state.</p><p>For all the protections it arrays around itself, a lich will go to greater lengths to guard its phylactery, as it knows that the destruction of this magical container spells doom for the lich. A lich is notoriously difficult to bargain with, though the threat of damaging its phylactery is a sure way to gain the upper hand in such a negotiation.</p>",

The traditional method of creating a mummy guardian is a laborious and sadistic process that begins well before the poor soul to be transformed is dead, during which the victim is ritualistically starved of nourishing food and instead fed strange spices, preservative agents, and toxins intended to quicken the desiccation of the flesh. The victim remains immobile but painfully aware during the final stages, where its now-useless entrails are extracted before it's shrouded in funerary wrappings and entombed within a necromantically ensorcelled sarcophagus to await intrusions in the potentially distant future. While it's certainly possible to use other methods to create a mummy guardian from an already-deceased body, those who seek to create these foul undead as their guardians in the afterlife often feel that such methods result in inferior undead-the pain and agony of death by mummification being an essential step in the process.</p><p>Regardless of the method of their creation, mummy guardians are more than just physical shells of flesh and bone-they retain fragmented, distorted versions of their minds, with only enough memories of their living personality remaining to fuel their undead anger and jealousy of those who yet live. This burning rage only intensifies over the centuries of waiting within a crypt for the chance to actually act, and thus when most mummy guardians are awoken by tomb robbers or adventurers, they stop at nothing in pursuit of glorious slaughter.</p><hr /><p>While many cultures practice mummification of the dead for benign reasons, undead mummies are created through foul rituals, typically to provide eternally vigilant guardians.</p>",

These necrohulk smashers are so swollen with biological and alchemical muscle enhancements that they can simply pound their way through enemies.</p><hr /><p>The strange, terrible energies swirling about on the winds and embedded in the earth of the Mana Wastes have led to unexpected changes and mutations in the bodies of those who dwell there. These mutants usually have little chance to escape their hardscrabble existence, as they're ostracized by other societies. People in the kingdom of Nex to the north look on such folk with suspicion, as do the dwarves of Alkenstar to the west. Surprisingly, the undead nation of Geb to the south is often the best hope for a future among people with unusual appearances.</p><p>Those who flee to Geb or are convinced to make it their home frequently find their welcome to be a false promise, however. Necromancers who long ago tired of animating the same humanoids find new potential in mutated flesh, and mutants who aren't careful might find themselves led into laboratories or crypts for experimentation.</p><p>Enterprising twilight sages of Yled's Mortuarium have innovated bizarre combinations of alchemy and necromancy that boost their victims' mutations to persist even after reanimation. Although these necrohulks are virtually mindless and require a constant influx of chemicals to retain their might, they're more than powerful enough to make the extremely difficult process worth the effort. The cartridge containing the alchemical formulation that sustains them is perhaps the trickiest part of necrohulk animation, and it's easiest to simply stitch the cartridge right into the necrohulk's flesh.</p><p>Yled's armies contain a growing number of necrohulks. This isn't solely because these juggernauts are frightening effective combatants on the field of battle; leveraging the instinctive revulsion that mutants create carries some strategic advantage. Although the occasional necrohulks do run amok in Yled, addled on the chemical cocktails that sustain them, military necromancers generally keep them under control.</p>",

A necromunculus may be loyal to its master, but it also seethes with hatred for all undead, including itself. If left to its own devices, a necromunculus immediately begins plotting to kill and gnaw upon any undead with whom it must regularly interact, even its master, even though it has no need to eat. A necromunculus cannot willingly act on this urge so long as it has some other command to obey, so their creators work hard to ensure that they are constantly supplied with tasks to keep them occupied.</p><p>Despite their cannibalistic urges, necromunculi are gaining increased in popularity among Geb's undead necromancers. Each creator wishes to see if they can imbue even more of their powers or personality in the delightfully treacherous servants. Besides, they make excellent practice in espionage and logical thinking for would-be Blood Lords.</p><p>Necromunculi resemble skeletal, impish humanoids with leathery wings. They are created from a mixture of mud, bonemeal, juniper oil, a few drops of blood from a still-living mammal, and a pound of the creator's own flesh, blood, or bone. Undead creatures lacking a corporeal body can use a pound of flesh, blood, or bone from another willing, intelligent undead subject, but the process generally destroys the volunteer.</p>",

Originally, shimmernewts were ordinary (if oversized) amphibians, living their lives between brackish coastal lakes or tidal pools and the steamy jungles nearby. Over time, the ambient chaotic energies flowing through Holomog magically altered their evolution. The shimmernewts of today barely resemble their ancestors.</p><p>Their inherent chaotic nature has resulted in shimmernewts operating on different cycles from one another. Some are diurnal, some are nocturnal, but most are crepuscular. Shimmernewts that live close to peaceful humanoid settlements are often docile, but wild populations, whether deep in the jungle or in proximity to more violent settlements, can be quite aggressive. When provoked, all shimmernewts can inflate their gills in impressive displays to appear more attractive to mates or more intimidating to rivals. The capricious amphibians lack any natural predators, and conservation- minded locals are trying to prevent them from migrating further inland.</p><p>Some underground rings host shimmernewt fights, an unsavory form of entertainment made alluring by lucrative betting. Strolling down the docks of any port town in Holomog for a few minutes provokes whispered invitations to these fights. Though many locals decry these fights as inhumane, each time a ring is shut down, another group pops up sooner or later.</p>",

They aren't fey, but their petite, winged forms and tendency for malevolent mischief has caused the appellation \"skull fairy\" to stick.</p><p>After bursting from the skull of the deceased, a skull fairy seeks out victims to behead. Skull fairies enjoy nothing more than the horrific sound of wrenching a head free from a body. They often wear the skulls of their most recent victim like caps atop their bulbous, oversized heads. Skull fairies take heads they've acquired to isolated caves, where they carefully strip off the flesh and put the skulls on display. If the skull fairy feels the need for new headgear, they hollow out a fresh skull to wear and retire the old one to a place of prominence.</p><p>A group of exactly three skull fairies who have each been alive for at least 13 years become much more powerful than their solitary or younger kin. Members of such a coven become stronger and more intelligent, and they set their minds to evil and chaos on a much wider scale-although anything more complicated than wandering about to twist off heads might seem aspirational to a skull fairy. Skull fairies that join a coven gain the elite adjustments and often acquire more powerful innate spells. Nondetection and stinking cloud are the most common spells a skull fairy coven can access, but others exist. A skull fairy can only join a coven consisting exclusively of other skull fairies.</p>",

A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless it is transported while it hides within its coffin, nor can it enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions-a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome its compulsion just as it does its revulsion.</li><li><strong>Revulsion</strong> A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of its revulsion, it gains the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Uciekający} condition, running from the object of its revulsion until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a vampire can attempt a @Check[will|dc:25|name:Overcome Revulsion] save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for [[/gmr 1d6 #rounds]]{1k6 rounds} (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li><li><strong>Stake</strong> A wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents it from healing above 0 HP, even in its coffin. Staking a vampire requires three actions and works only if the vampire is unconscious. If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if it's in its coffin the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire's head is severed and anointed with <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.z9T4c1hXwOotsMCp]{Holy Water}</em> while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed.</li><li><strong>Sunlight</strong> If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Spowolniony 1}. The slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends its turn in sunlight. If the vampire loses all its actions in this way, it is destroyed.
