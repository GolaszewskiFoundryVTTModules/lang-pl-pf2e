A Harrowing Vision takes an hour to perform, but most of that time consists of Hajeck and her chosen subject meditating and clearing their minds in a secluded area, culminating in an intense harrow reading that itself takes only a few minutes to complete. The target of a Harrowing Vision must remain adjacent to Hajeck for the entire hour, after which Hajeck shuffles her harrow deck and lays out seven cards, face down—one in the center (the future), two to either side (the present), and four more at the top, bottom, left, and right surrounding the central three (the past).</p>\n<p>When the harrowing takes place, the target flips over the four cards from the past, followed by the two present cards, and then finally the central card. This method of harrowing symbolizes how the choices a person made in their past often present them with an either/or decision in the now, and that their decision on that subject will lock in a future result. When All-Seeing Hajeck performs this reading for a PC, try to interpret the four cards from the past as representing events from that character's history—be it their background or references to events that took place during the Stolen Fate Adventure Path. For the two cards representing the present, try to interpret them as symbols of questions, events, or mysteries the PC is currently facing.</p>\n<p>Only the card representing the future has an actual game effect. When this central, final card is revealed, all of the PCs' potential futures suddenly flash in their mind in an overwhelming, chaotic vision. The PC must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:32] save (note that as a PC grows more powerful and their Will save increases, they're more likely to achieve a better result from a Harrowing Vision, since they're that much closer to their ultimate destiny and are bolstered by the weight of their previous choices and decisions). If the suit of the card revealed for the PCs' future matches the PC's key ability from their class, they gain a +1 status bonus on this Will save. If the alignment of the card revealed matches the PC's alignment, they gain a +2 status bonus to this will save. If both match, these bonuses stack to a +3 status bonus, and the actual result of the save is improved by one degree of success. If neither the suit or alignment match the PC, they reduce the actual result of the save by one degree of success. Regardless of the result, that character cannot receive another Harrowing Vision until they gain a level, at which point any lingering effects from the Harrowing Vision end.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The character experiences a vision of a specific future success, only to forget it an instant later. Once only as long as this effect persists when the character is affected by a critical failure for any roll they make or a critical success with any roll a foe makes, the character can change that roll into a Success or a Failure, as they see fit. In addition, the character gains the</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> benefit detailed below.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The character experiences several overlapping potential successes in their future. As long as this effect persists (typically until the character gains a level), the maximum size of their hand for investing cards from the Deck of Destiny increases by 1 to six cards.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The vision is confusing and frightening, but has no lasting effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Not only is the vision confusing and frightening, but the character becomes obsessed with worst-case scenarios, becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.3uh1r86TzbQvosxv]{Doomed 1}, and becomes cursed—they can no longer gain the benefit of their best possible futures. As long as this curse persists, the character treats all critical successes as regular successes. This is a misfortune effect.</p>"

When the plant senses the approach of suitable prey through its sensitive, shallowly buried root system, it rises up like an agitated snake and unfurls its brightly colored bloom, an act that releases a cloud of mind-numbing pollen. Persistent stories claim the viper vine can lure prey into its clutches by swaying with a hypnotic motion, but this effect is in fact created by this invisible, odorless pollen cloud.</p>\n<p>Since a viper vine gains nourishment by consuming creatures rather than through ingesting moisture and soil, it has developed rudimentary locomotion and can drag itself along the ground with its tentacle-like roots. It even has a form of rudimentary sentience, allowing it to not only discern differences in prey and make limited tactical decisions, but also to avoid creatures that are particularly large or dangerous-looking.</p>\n<p>The area around viper vine hunting grounds is often strewn with the partially devoured remains of victims. It's not unusual to find the rotting corpses of wild animals, ill-fated adventurers, and even giants in the plant's immediate vicinity, along with a scattering of incidental treasure left behind on the corpses. A viper vine rarely returns to the carcass of a creature it killed earlier, preferring to hunt fresh meat.</p>",

Regardless of whether Shory magic was responsible for the birth of the first derhiis, lore passed down from those times shows the Shory Empire honored their soldiers and treated them as valued allies rather than mere servants.</p>\n<p>Derhiis are scarce even in the Mwangi Expanse, where the last of the Shory flying cities, such as Kho and Ulduvai, fell. Still, some dwell among the spires that tower above Shory ruins; these derhii are often quite a bit more powerful than the one detailed below. Other derhiis have spread from the remains of the fallen Shory empire to populate remote highlands and old-growth forests.</p>\n<p>Derhiis form small filial groups called troops, centered on one elder derhii and their relations. Several troops might gather into a larger society with a council of troop leaders under one dominant elder. Derhiis are omnivores who favor meat, unlike the terrestrial and largely herbivorous gorillas they resemble. It's possible that this habit developed due to a derhii need for substantial amounts of food coupled with their soldierly ways.</p>\n<h2>Derhii Artistry</h2>\n<p>Derhiis have little use for money, but they're talented crafters. Their goods are practical, beautiful and, when needed, deadly. Shory influences can still be seen in derhii art, including crystalline designs, beadwork, and geometric patterns that hint at the arcane. Derhii leatherwork and metalwork is also top notch, owing to their desire for functional, durable armaments.</p>",

They watch over all life, intervening with reluctance when called upon-or with a vengeance when the strands of fate are twisted and abused by lesser beings.</p>\n<p>Norns' relationship with the Eldest of the First World is complex. Many among norns serve Magdh the Three, the triune Eldest who some norns believe to be the first norn triumvirate bound together into one entity, as Magdh has three bodies: a Maiden, a Mother, and a Matriarch. Magdh claims to be watching the threads of fate for some ominous prophesied cataclysm, and in addition to assisting in her divinations, Magdh expects the norns who serve her to follow her cryptic commands to help nudge the future away from the brink. However, norns are powerful beings in their own right, themselves capable of granting divine power, and many balk at serving the enigmatic demigod. These norns find the other Eldest even more alien and challenging to interact with, for they believe that while the Eldest wield great power, even these powerful beings should not be granted leave to meddle with fate as much as they desire.</p>\n<p>While even the weakest of the Eldest could destroy an unaffiliated norn with ease, they tend to obey the proclamations and judgments of norns when they are spoken. These norns, for their part, use their perceived neutrality judiciously. They know better than to issue too many demands to the Eldest, lest the capricious demigods grow frustrated and tired of norns' interference. And so the balance of power remains tenuous between unaffiliated norns and the Eldest, as it has for eons. However, norns know that it's merely a matter of time before the Eldest lose their respect for this tradition and start acting entirely as they please, despite norns' best efforts to rein in their most disruptive actions.</p>\n<p>A norn stands 14 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.</p>\n<p>Worshipping Norns On the Material Plane, some mortals worship norns as deities, while others, especially witches and bards, admire them as patrons or muses. Those who uphold norns as deities are known as Followers of Fate. Norns do little to discourage this veneration, but neither do they go out of their way to support such worship. Clerics who venerate norns might worship a specific norn or norn triumvirate, or all norns as a whole, but they gain the same benefits regardless of their choice. The religious symbol of Followers of Fate is a pair of shears cutting a golden thread, and their areas of concern are destiny, fate, and the aging process.</p>",

They watch over all life, intervening with reluctance when called upon-or with a vengeance when the strands of fate are twisted and abused by lesser beings.</p>\n<p>Norns' relationship with the Eldest of the First World is complex. Many among norns serve Magdh the Three, the triune Eldest who some norns believe to be the first norn triumvirate bound together into one entity, as Magdh has three bodies: a Maiden, a Mother, and a Matriarch. Magdh claims to be watching the threads of fate for some ominous prophesied cataclysm, and in addition to assisting in her divinations, Magdh expects the norns who serve her to follow her cryptic commands to help nudge the future away from the brink. However, norns are powerful beings in their own right, themselves capable of granting divine power, and many balk at serving the enigmatic demigod. These norns find the other Eldest even more alien and challenging to interact with, for they believe that while the Eldest wield great power, even these powerful beings should not be granted leave to meddle with fate as much as they desire.</p>\n<p>While even the weakest of the Eldest could destroy an unaffiliated norn with ease, they tend to obey the proclamations and judgments of norns when they are spoken. These norns, for their part, use their perceived neutrality judiciously. They know better than to issue too many demands to the Eldest, lest the capricious demigods grow frustrated and tired of norns' interference. And so the balance of power remains tenuous between unaffiliated norns and the Eldest, as it has for eons. However, norns know that it's merely a matter of time before the Eldest lose their respect for this tradition and start acting entirely as they please, despite norns' best efforts to rein in their most disruptive actions.</p>\n<p>A norn stands 14 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.</p>\n<p>Worshipping Norns On the Material Plane, some mortals worship norns as deities, while others, especially witches and bards, admire them as patrons or muses. Those who uphold norns as deities are known as Followers of Fate. Norns do little to discourage this veneration, but neither do they go out of their way to support such worship. Clerics who venerate norns might worship a specific norn or norn triumvirate, or all norns as a whole, but they gain the same benefits regardless of their choice. The religious symbol of Followers of Fate is a pair of shears cutting a golden thread, and their areas of concern are destiny, fate, and the aging process.</p>",

Many among norns serve Magdh the Three, the triune Eldest who some norns believe to be the first norn triumvirate bound together into one entity, as Magdh has three bodies: a Maiden, a Mother, and a Matriarch. Magdh claims to be watching the threads of fate for some ominous prophesied cataclysm, and in addition to assisting in her divinations, Magdh expects the norns who serve her to follow her cryptic commands to help nudge the future away from the brink. However, norns are powerful beings in their own right, themselves capable of granting divine power, and many balk at serving the enigmatic demigod. These norns find the other Eldest even more alien and challenging to interact with, for they believe that while the Eldest wield great power, even these powerful beings should not be granted leave to meddle with fate as much as they desire.</p>\n<p>While even the weakest of the Eldest could destroy an unaffiliated norn with ease, they tend to obey the proclamations and judgments of norns when they are spoken. These norns, for their part, use their perceived neutrality judiciously. They know better than to issue too many demands to the Eldest, lest the capricious demigods grow frustrated and tired of norns' interference. And so the balance of power remains tenuous between unaffiliated norns and the Eldest, as it has for eons. However, norns know that it's merely a matter of time before the Eldest lose their respect for this tradition and start acting entirely as they please, despite norns' best efforts to rein in their most disruptive actions.</p>\n<p>A norn stands 14 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.</p>\n<p>Worshipping Norns On the Material Plane, some mortals worship norns as deities, while others, especially witches and bards, admire them as patrons or muses. Those who uphold norns as deities are known as Followers of Fate. Norns do little to discourage this veneration, but neither do they go out of their way to support such worship. Clerics who venerate norns might worship a specific norn or norn triumvirate, or all norns as a whole, but they gain the same benefits regardless of their choice. The religious symbol of Followers of Fate is a pair of shears cutting a golden thread, and their areas of concern are destiny, fate, and the aging process.</p>",

This doesn't comfort goblins, of course, who have a particularly strong fear of harpies.

They use captivating songs to lure creatures in, then murder them while they stand transfixed. They enjoy causing confusion and fear in their prey before they strike, believing it creates a savory flavor in the flesh. Harpies can eat most creatures but strongly prefer sapient prey-humans and elves are their favorite. Although harpies will eat goblins if sufficiently hungry, they dislike their flavor and avoid eating them if possible. This doesn't comfort goblins, of course, who have a particularly strong fear of harpies. Because their aeries often reek with the gore of their kills and careless spatters of guano, harpies carry a distinctly vile scent that canny travelers associate with danger. Harpies who roost close to civilization make better efforts to keep clean, though these efforts have mixed results.</p>\n<p>Harpies live in family groups or larger clans. They are lightweight despite their size, standing 5 feet tall and weighing only around 90 pounds. While most use relatively simple weapons, some harpies take pride in learning and mastering the use of more complex tools of war such as swords and slings. Those who master the use of the bow, in particular, are often regarded as heroes among their kind and terrors among their victims.</p>",

Like snakes, nagaji are cold-blooded and reproduce by laying eggs; as a result, nagaji territories rarely overlap with those of mammalian humanoids, since their environmental needs diverge so widely. They're a hardy and strong people, but their close ties to nagas mean many have the potential for powerful magic, as well.</p>\n<p>Long ago, the naga goddess Nalinivati created the first nagaji as the backbone of a society that respected nagas. But the nagaji were never mindless vassals, and the goddess gifted them with free will. Many nagaji willingly serve nagas to this day, honoring some as outright divinities. While outsiders might regard nagaji initially as brainwashed servants, nagaji dispute this claim. Of course there are evil and unfair naga overlords, but there are just as many fair and just naga rulers, and nagaji history remembers various rebellions and revolutions when a matriarch overstepped her bounds to support a new naga's claims of rulership. Nagaji accurately note that their long history with nagas is no simple matter and claim that the partnership goes both ways: nagas rely as much on nagaji for the running of their empires as nagaji rely on nagas to lead their people to prosperity.</p>\n<p>Although nagaji might be encountered in diverse cities and urban centers, their communities are concentrated in environments that suit their biology, namely jungles and tropical forests. Where many species would languish in the heat and humidity, nagaji bask in the warmth and thrive.</p>",

These tresses and full skirts in fact disguise the huldra's supernatural features: a hollow wooden back, a long bovine tail, and incredible strength.</p>\n<p>Folk legends from the lands of the north describe huldras as the creations of troll witches, intended to lure potential meals to the slaughter. Indeed, a huldra's regeneration is so similar to a troll's that a link between the two creatures seems entirely possible, but huldras despise trolls and resent tales suggesting any connection between them. Rather, huldras are wardens of the woodlands they occupy. Grown from saplings by powerful forest-dwelling fey as a response to humanoid encroachment, huldras protect and parley for the forest itself. Woodland creatures adore huldras, and sometimes approach humans or elves thinking they're huldras. This illusion is shattered if the animal sees the humanoid's back is made of flesh or that they're lacking a tail, at which point the animal recoils and runs away.</p>\n<p>Huldras respond well to travelers who show respect and deference for the forest, bestowing those they favor with supernatural luck and fortune. Those who scorn or attack a huldra, or those who mock their distinctive, bovine tails, find themselves plagued by poor decisions and even worse luck. Huldras commonly carry a bad reputation as sirens of the deep forest-cunning monsters who seek to lure woodcutters and unwary adventurers to uncertain ends. These stories largely come from miscreants foolish enough to have treated a huldra rudely and later complain about how they were unjustly persecuted. Even woodcutters and hunters can stay in the good graces of huldras provided they plant few trees to replace what they've taken and don't kill any creatures they don't eat.</p>\n<p>Though huldras choose to appear unassuming, the attention they put into disguising the supernatural parts of their bodies is sometimes lacking when it comes to their strength. They often perform feats of strength, like bending horseshoes straight or lifting heavy objects, without realizing they're breaking their carefully crafted facade.</p>",

After long years of research and the creation of a special container called a phylactery, a spellcaster takes the final step by imbibing a deadly concoction or casting dreadful incantations that transform them into a lich. While most undertake this drastic plan to continue their work or fulfill some long-term plan, others become liches because they fear death or to fulfill some malevolent purpose, such as long-sworn revenge. Regardless, the result is permanent and carries with it the potential to alter history-both that of those who transform themselves and of the countless mortals that will inevitably suffer as a result of a lich's new power.</p>\n<p>After its metamorphosis, a lich often finds some quiet place to dwell, typically protected by a variety of guardians and traps, for two primary purposes. First, a lich requires solitude in order to plan its elaborate schemes, and second, few mortals (if any) deign to interact with these legendarily corrupt necromancers. One reason begets the other, as the self-imposed isolation of a lich often drives the lich insane, further solidifying its separation from civilization. The longer a lich lives, the more meticulous a planner it becomes, secreting itself within a labyrinth of deadly puzzles, misdirection, and monsters. A lich's servants and guardians are absolutely loyal, either due to their nature (such as constructs or other undead) or as a result of compulsion using powerful magic. Many liches go mad, in time, and the nature of a lich's lair is a good indicator of the undead's current mental state.</p>\n<p>For all the protections it arrays around itself, a lich will go to greater lengths to guard its phylactery, as it knows that the destruction of this magical container spells doom for the lich. A lich is notoriously difficult to bargain with, though the threat of damaging its phylactery is a sure way to gain the upper hand in such a negotiation.</p>",

Although their opinions are changeable, crystal dragons prefer orderly environments and are not fond of sudden interruptions or distractions.</p>\n<p>Crystal dragons build their lairs in underground grottoes, where they cultivate environments of great beauty. Their exacting standards and vivid imaginations mean that they are always working to improve the appearance or layout of some part of their lair. These lairs are unique to each individual crystal dragon, but there are always plenty of reflective surfaces that allow the dragon to observe their own appearance. These range from crystals to reflecting pools to finely crafted mirrors, which are arranged throughout the lair in a pleasing array. Gifts of well-crafted or magical mirrors are an excellent way to curry favor with a crystal dragon.</p>\n<p>Although crystal dragons are easily distracted by their sparkling collections or their vanity, they remain good-hearted creatures at the core and make friends quickly. While a crystal dragon tends to find evil creatures uncouth and unpleasant, any other nearby denizen or inhabitant of their home could become fast friends or beloved pets, depending upon the creature's capacity for conversation (and for providing the frequent praise and compliments that crystal dragons hunger for).</p>",

The demon lord and his minions claim the air around the cliff, guarding it against enemies and usurpers alike. Hurlilus, resembling horned, humanoid hawks with blood-red taloned feet and wings in place of arms, patrol these skies at their lord's command. Yet, hurlilus are surly and rebellious by nature, preferring to lead rather than follow orders. They'd prefer to spend their time bullying smaller creatures in High M'Vania's vast cliffside cities, but they're unwelcome there and driven out when discovered by occupants with greater authority (or by those who want to earn greater authority).</p>\n<p>Hurlilus make good guardians, particularly when they have leave to travel over great distances on patrol routes and can engage in spontaneous cruelty if the opportunity arises. However, they chafe in Pazuzu's service. Some forsake High M'Vania entirely and migrate to other parts of the Abyss, where they lead gangs of lesser fiends they've bullied into submission. A few hurlilus have made their way to Golarion, where they roost in aeries with subservient harpies, manticores, or other foul flying creatures. A dozen or so hurlilus serve high positions in the Mivanians, the brutal enforcers of the Halana Theocracy.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The hurlilu is the weakest and smallest of the avian fiends collectively known as lilus. All lilus are chaotic evil fiends who can fly, are immune to disease, have mixed avian and humanoid appearances, possess darkvision and lifesense, and resist physical damage (except from cold iron). Most have a selection of primal innate spells (often including a primal version of <em>dimension door</em>).</p>",
