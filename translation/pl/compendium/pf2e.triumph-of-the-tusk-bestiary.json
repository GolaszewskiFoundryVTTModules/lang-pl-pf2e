            "name": "Aurochs",
            "publicNotes": "<p>This massive bovine looks like a larger, wilder version of the domesticated cattle found throughout the Inner Sea region. During winter, vast herds of the animals roam the southern reaches of the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, but as the ice high in the mountains begins to melt, the aurochs migrate south into Belkzen, following their ancestral route along the Flood Road. Once the water flows in earnest and turns to massive floods, the sudden surge of greenery provides the aurochs with all the food they need to survive.</p><p>Aurochs are essential to life in Belkzen. Not only do the orcs there hunt the wild cattle for their meat, but they use every part of the aurochs, from hide to bones, to craft their weapons and tools. The aurochs' arrival prompts the beginning of the Flood Truce, during which the usually war-focused orc holds cease all hostilities to take advantage of this time of plenty.</p><p>While groups of 20 or fewer animals are sometimes encountered, most aurochs travel in herds that stretch to the horizon. The land thunders under the weight of these herds, and the dust kicked up by their hooves is often spotted days before the aurochs — or the floodwaters that spurred their migration — arrive.</p><p>Aurochs bulls stand between 6 and 7 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh around 2 500 pounds, although prodigious specimens can grow to over 7 feet tall and 3 000 pounds. Cows are smaller, standing near 6 feet at the shoulder and weighing up to 2 000 pounds. All aurochs have slightly curved horns that grow up to three feet long from base to spear-sharp tip.</p><p>The aurochs is represented in much of Belkzen's artwork. Not only are the animals vital to survival in that unforgiving land, but their strength, power, and tenacity serve as potent symbols for orc holds.</p><h2>Aurochs Rolling</h2><p>Farmers throughout the Inner Sea often joke about cow tipping: sneaking up on an unsuspecting bovine and pushing it over while it sleeps. But since cattle sleep lying down, the animal usually has the last laugh. Nonetheless, some younger orcs in Belkzen spend evenings creeping up on sleeping aurochs to roll them over. This usually results in little more than a startled aurochs.</p>",

Having adapted to the arid mountain terrain, aurochs herds eat a much more diverse diet of scrub and brush than their domesticated counterparts as they steadily migrate down the Flood Road. The herds show little patience for predators and demonstrate a preference for charging threats with their razor-sharp horns. Bull aurochs display natural instincts to strategically protect other, weaker members of the herd, often surprising intruders with their coordinated tactics and defensive maneuvers.</p><h2>Unlikely War Beasts</h2><p>Followers of Zagresh have a history of capturing wild aurochs for use in magical experiments, taking the strongest of a herd to make the beasts even larger and more aggressive. Once the aurochs have been transformed into monstrous goliaths, their captors bard them with armored plates and magical weapons that complement their horns. In battle, these aurochs are utilized to pull siege weapons, break through enemy defenses, and trample frontline forces.</p>",

Bristle boars are all three. Many orcs admire the bristle boar, viewing them as living symbols of the toughness Belkzen demands from its inhabitants. With their spiny manes, sharp tusks, keen noses, and irascible nature, the creatures are both intimidating and dangerous.</p><p>Hunters throughout the Inner Sea region know that taking down a wild boar can prove deadly for the unprepared. Bristle boars — the name given to both male and female specimen — are even more challenging to kill. Further, their meat is sinewy, so few hunters even bother with the animals. For those who fell the beasts, the boars' spined hides often serve as trophies of the hunter's skill.</p><p>Bristle boars are not as reliant on the Deluge as other animals in Belkzen. Though they're certainly found in the green areas that spring up during the annual flooding, sounders of bristle boars can survive even in desolate areas like the Dirt Sea, grubbing for sustenance where few others can. The Cleft Head Hold maintains a small herd of tamed bristle boars.</p><p>The orcs have learned that, with the right trainer, the clever animals make excellent companions. Aside from their utility in battle, the boars are often used to sniff out the rare yellow truffles that grow throughout the hold.</p><p>A typical bristle boar stands 4 feet tall and weighs roughly 200 pounds.</p><h2>Stuck Treasure</h2><p>Although they don't seek out shiny objects like some animals, bristle boars who evade hunters often escape with weapons embedded in their thick hides. The Empty Hand orcs tell of a famous bristle boar dubbed \"Silverspear\" after the silvery spear stuck in its hide. Stories claim the boar's spear is imbued with powerful magic, and while many warriors have hunted Silverspear to claim its weapon, so far none have succeeded.</p>",

Generations of selective breeding favored larger animals suited to Belkzen's harsh environment and fearsome predators, resulting in the modern war pig. During the flood season, these pigs gorge and grow fat, gradually consuming their reserves to become leaner and meaner during the rest of the year.</p><p>Arguably domesticated, war pigs rarely remain in captivity for more than a few generations. Most orcs loathe the notion of their swine becoming too tame, instead releasing part of their herd every year to grow fierce before recapturing them seasons later. The downside is that these feral swine associate humanoids with food. Rogue war pigs sometimes form roving gangs that uproot fields, run amok, and even knock over trade caravans to eat rations (and the occasional merchant).</p><p>The \"war\" in war pigs comes from their use as mounts. With the right motivation, a war pig is a porcine juggernaut able to carry a fully armored orc into combat. Without discipline, care, and treats, that same pig can become 600 pounds of willful chaos that's as likely to trample foes as it is to flee combat, find a mud puddle, and crush its rider after flopping down to vigorously wallow.</p>",

Some claim that water orms are an offshoot of sea serpents and linnorms, but no credible link between these creatures has been found.</p><p>Water orms have many features that sea serpents do not, such as the ability to understand the rudiments of language. Their natural inclination to avoid contact and remain hidden often remains at odds with their equally compelling curiosity about those they might spy upon the shores of their lakes. Water orm sightings usually occur when they can't help but to rise up to the surface to take a peek at someone particularly unusual on the beach or floating on the water's surface.</p><p>These creatures are extremely long-lived and can go for decades, or even centuries, with very little to eat. This allows water orms to subsist in lakes without surfacing for many years, even in bodies of fresh water without ample food sources. Water orms might lie in a silty lake bed for years, their elusiveness only contributing to their mythical reputation. When a pet or child goes missing near a lake, rumors might hold that the local water orm is responsible, leading to folk tales that caution residents against venturing out alone near the water.</p><p>While most water orms are described as serpentine or long-necked reptiles, others look similar to bizarrely elongated seals or whales, impossibly large sea horses, or long-necked creatures with paddles resembling those of elasmosauruses.</p>",

Orcs were considerably braver, yet even they're wary of monsters swimming through the silt. To an outsider, palpares might seem like a cautionary tale to keep children from sinking into the quicksand, and the large pits found dotting the Sea of Dirt's shores are just geological phenomena that appear in the wet season. Those who have stumbled across these traps know the dangerous reality.</p><p>Few know much about palpares, an enormous insect whose plated, hulking abdomen takes up most of its size. They seem to be solitary ambush hunters that hibernate during the dry season, then awaken during the Flood to create their enormous pit traps. These traps capture prey of all sizes, even the occasional herd of migrating aurochs, as they wait buried in the center. Though usually very patient, when disturbed, a palpares can move through its native sandy soil surprisingly quick, greeting intruders who enter its domain with its shovellike head and vicious pincers.</p><h2>Life Stages</h2><p>Research suggests palpares aren't yet in its final form of life, as large caverns on the shores have been discovered to hold traces of chitin and the rotting remains of palpares partially transformed. Though nobody has encountered an adult and lived to tell the tale, rumors abound that the fully fledged insect form resembles Rovagug. Communities are quick to locate and dispose of any pupae they find in large, sand-encrusted mounds in the dirt. Some towns hold large barbecues to harvest tons of \"mud bacon.\"</p>",

Their hunger is targeted toward the living — those whose pumping hearts and ruddy warmth inspire visceral hatred.</p><p>As many types of wights exist as types of people from which they might be created. Hulking brutes, skittering sneaks, and cunning tinkers all make for different wights with different niches to fill. The environment, too, plays a part in determining a wight's special abilities and defenses. Frost wights, for instance, can be found in parts of the world where exposure is a common end and the resentment of being left alone in the wild is a common source of spite. Durable and sustained by void energy, wights can last in harsh environments without decaying the way some lesser undead do.</p><p>A single wight can wreak significant havoc if it is compelled to rise from its tomb. Because creatures slain under a wight's curse can become wights as well, all it takes is a single wight and a handful of unlucky graveyard visitors to create a veritable horde of these undead. Thus, canny priests and adventurers know that the best solution to a wight problem is swift and total eradication.

Polegają na swojej niesamowitej sile, aby obezwładniać wrogów swoimi okrutnymi szponami i zębatymi paszczami. Te trolle mierzą od 3.5 do niemal 5 metrów wzrostu, choć dla wygody wolą się garbić i usypiać czujność wrogów fałszywym poczuciem bezpieczeństwa. Trolle prawdziwie są stworzeniami lasu, głęboko związanymi ciałem i krwią z bujnymi siedliskami, które uważają za swoje terytorium. Do tego stopnia, że kiedy troll leśny zostaje zabity, jego ciało zamienia się w sczerniałe bryły węgla drzewnego, często nadal pełne rozżarzonych grudek. Pomimo to, stworzenia te wędrują dalej i szerzej niż większość ich pobratymców, w wyniku czego są pierwszymi stworzeniami, o których myśli zwykły człowiek, gdy słyszy słowo \"troll\".</p><hr /><p>Zaślinieni, okrutni, niepokonani brutale: tak opisałby przeciętny wieśniak, te budzące grozę potwory znane jako trolle. Korzenie tych opowieści są niewątpliwie prawdziwe. Ciało trolli odrasta nieustannie, posuwając się nawet do wypuszczania dziwacznych kończyn lub dodatkowych głów, jeśli nie zostanie przycięte, a ich nienasycony głód jest konieczny, aby podtrzymać tak nieokiełznany wzrost. Nawet w trakcie obżerania się, trolle znajdują jednak okazje, aby drwić ze swoich ofiar i zadawać im drobne okrucieństwa.</p><p>Zdolność trolli do przetrwania jest tak potężna, że wierzą one, iż nawet najmniejszy skrawek ciała powoli zregeneruje się w nową formę, cierpiąc katusze, gdy wszystkie moce ziemi zbierają się, aby je wskrzesić. Pomimo bólu, trolle opowiadają o tej niezwyciężonej witalności jako o błogosławieństwie od swojego stwórcy. Niewiele trolli słyszało śmiech demonów, które twierdzą, że ów stwórca przeklął trolle i strącił je z wyniosłych wyżyn, spętując je tak, aby nigdy więcej nie mogły się podnieść.</p><p>Trolle wolą żyć samotnie, zachowując każdy skrawek pożywienia dla siebie. W rzadkich wypadkach stary i potężny troll staje na czele grup trolli. Tacy hersztowie wojenni posiadają wystarczającą przebiegłość, by prowadzić swoje hordy w niszczycielskich najazdach i masakrach, a ich obecność trwale zmienia otaczający ekosystem. To powiązanie z ich środowiskiem jest często niezrozumianym aspektem troli i staje się coraz wyraźniejsze wraz z wiekiem i mocą trolla. Nie znaczy to, że trolle są dzielnymi obrońcami natury. Są nikczemne i terytorialne, i zniszczą swoje własne terytorium na zawsze, jeśli będzie to oznaczać więcej jedzenia na jeden dzień.</p>",

This spite might come from their own malevolent will in life, or can be instilled by necromantic rituals, typically involving the desecration of burial sites. Wights usually haunt burial grounds, catacombs, or other places of the dead. Their hunger is targeted toward the living — those whose pumping hearts and ruddy warmth inspire visceral hatred.</p><p>As many types of wights exist as types of people from which they might be created. Hulking brutes, skittering sneaks, and cunning tinkers all make for different wights with different niches to fill. The environment, too, plays a part in determining a wight's special abilities and defenses. Frost wights, for instance, can be found in parts of the world where exposure is a common end and the resentment of being left alone in the wild is a common source of spite. Durable and sustained by void energy, wights can last in harsh environments without decaying the way some lesser undead do.</p><p>A single wight can wreak significant havoc if it is compelled to rise from its tomb. Because creatures slain under a wight's curse can become wights as well, all it takes is a single wight and a handful of unlucky graveyard visitors to create a veritable horde of these undead. Thus, canny priests and adventurers know that the best solution to a wight problem is swift and total eradication. Care must be taken, though, to destroy wight spawn before attempting to destroy the parent wight, for spawn without a master gain the ability to create spawn of their own.</p>",
