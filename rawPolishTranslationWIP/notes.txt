system devs were kind enough to start exporting a specific zip at each release for translations, th're not encoded, look at the json-assets.zip https://github.com/foundryvtt/pf2e/releases/tag/5.0.1
so in a script you always use that URL to get the latest files for translation : https://github.com/foundryvtt/pf2e/releases/latest/download/json-assets.zip

oh, you're trying to figure out the name of the Babele file you need to make ?
what we use is the mapping provided in the system.json file : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foundryvtt/pf2e/master/static/system.json
