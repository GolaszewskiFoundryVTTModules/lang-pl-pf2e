The most popular theory, as reflected in various religious iconography, is that Aakriti is the pupae of a primordial deity that took damage in their chrysalis state and became unable to molt into their final form.</p><p>Known as Aakriti the Evershifting, this ooze deity represents the ever-evolving nature of creation and life as well the potential of the unknown. New life crawls forth from their primordial depths in an explosion of the bizarre and colorful, adjusting in their own individual ways to the challenges of existence. As each life moves through the various cycles of growth over time, they must be flexible and adapt to the changes, especially at its crux — the state of transition. Sometimes a new step involves a frightening destruction of identity, but it should be embraced instead of feared, as the primordial nothingness holds the potential for new creations beyond the wildest imaginings of one's current self. Those who stay rigid in their beliefs or refuse to change will become trapped in the shells of their old selves and crush themselves in their struggle to avoid growth. Aakriti also has no love for those who entrap creatures into a form unwillingly and will sometimes intercede against them.</p><p><strong>Title</strong> The Evershifting</p><p><strong>Obszary Wpływów</strong> Discovery, life, ooze, potential</p><p><strong>Edykty</strong></p><ul><li>Create without reservation</li><li>Help others unlock their true potential</li><li>Observe the mysteries of life</li></ul><p><strong>Anatemy</strong></p><ul><li>Fail to study a new creature if safely able</li><li>Force a creature to live in the wrong body</li><li>Reject creatures or information due to bigoted or rigid beliefs</li></ul><p><strong>Symbol Religijny</strong> molting cicada</p><p><strong>Święte Zwierzę</strong> insect</p><p><strong>Święte Barwy</strong> all</p>"

As Embaral sent gentle waves onto the shores adjoining his waters to better understand them, the goddess Vudravati was drawn to his persistence and patience, and the two fell in love.</p><p>But Vudravati also loved Embaral's twin, Obari. While the goddess was happy to take both as lovers, the jealous brothers soon went to war with each other for her affections. Obari sent typhoons to stir chaos in Embaral's waters, while Embaral stilled the winds raised by his brother and flooded the distant lands that Obari loved. The other ocean gods attempted to intervene to disastrous effect, with many losing their lives and immortality in the ensuing battles. As the war spilled across borders and waves, other gods of sea and storm abandoned their traditional demesnes to help shield mortals from the effects of the brothers' wrath. They created bays and seas, coordinating with gods of earth and stone to form peninsulas and islands, anything that the immortal powers could arrange to curtail the brother's influence and stay the fallout of their wrath. A few gods and immortal beings of the great waters fled Golarion altogether, seeking worlds and dominions that were not active battlegrounds for potent and violent immortal forces.

The order was founded in 3988 RA when the gentleman-explorer Aldus Canter returned from the Osirian desert where he had been lost for 3 years. Aldus spoke of meeting a cult following a desiccated angel named Tabris. Tabris revealed the secret history of the multiverse and tasked Aldus with acting as a messenger of mystic secrets. Upon his return, Aldus gathered a coterie of his fellow Ustalavic nobles eager to plumb these secrets. His message was far from clear, however, consisting of garbled and coded texts in an untidy medley of Osirian mysticism, Pharasmin rites, and Varisian occult lore. Scouring Aldus's texts-both those brought from Osirion and his many annotations and reinterpretations penned thereafter-has been the order's primary activity for centuries, even before the increasingly erratic Aldus disappeared in 4028 RA. The Esoteric Order's meticulous research has produced occult secrets and mystical rites known nowhere else on Golarion and hints at further secret lore for the enlightened. The order's greatest accomplishment, however, was averting a doomsday few on Golarion will ever realize was imminent: in 4718 RA, the order's greatest heroes prevented the planet Aucturn from devouring Golarion.</p><p><strong>Członkowie Przymierza</strong> mysterious forces</p><p><strong>Obszary Wpływów</strong> history, occultism, secret lore</p><p><strong>Edykty</strong></p><ul><li>Honor the rites of the order while pushing for change</li><li>Provide succor to scholars and truth-seekers</li><li>Pursue the wisdom of ancient forgotten texts such as the lost gospels of tabris</li></ul><p><strong>Anatemy</strong></p><ul><li>Destroy rare or ancient lore</li><li>Dismiss or remain ignorant to the newly found texts</li><li>Reveal the order's secrets to those outside the organization</li></ul><p><strong>Symbol Religijny</strong> golden scarab beetle with outstretched wings revealing an eye</p>"

When he was sated and flew to seek other prey, Kzininn wasn't quite dead, but he was angry.</p><p>Over time, he regrew. Where once there was soft flesh, waxy cuticles took shape. Rounded leaves gave way to menacing thorns. The sweet sap became bitter with toxins. Kzininn remained a guardian of nature, yet he had rebuilt himself into a bristling juggernaut.</p><p>Since then, Kzininn has championed cacti, brambles, nightshades, and other hazardous plants, encouraging flora to evolve defenses so that they don't fall prey to remorseless fauna. His followers often seed nettles to ward off grazers from vulnerable undergrowth. Worshippers incorporate small spines into their attire, and although intimacy isn't discouraged, the faithful are expected to exercise healthy physical and social boundaries.</p><p>Kzininn's realm winds through the Shattered Peaks of western Nex and Katapesh, spilling into parts of the Mwangi Expanse. He is reclusive, rarely revealing himself but instead encouraging his wards to develop increasingly deadly — if not outright carnivorous — defenses. It seems Kzininn views the cultivation of pesh cacti in Katapesh with particular disdain; his disciples occasionally liberate or even animate the cacti to revolt, tearing apart their farmers to water the soil with blood.</p><p><strong>Title</strong> The Prince of Thorns</p><p><strong>Obszary Wpływów</strong> Dangerous plants, boundaries, harsh lessons</p><p><strong>Edykty</strong></p><ul><li>Equip the weak to defend themselves</li><li>Preserve areas of natural wilderness</li><li>Confront those who trespass and despoil</li><li>Embrace scars</li></ul><p><strong>Anatemy</strong></p><ul><li>Allow flagrant abuse of plant life to go unpunished</li><li>Prune a plant's natural defenses</li><li>Fully heal wounds inflicted by plants</li></ul><p><strong>Symbol Religijny</strong> budding flower growing from a wound</p><p><strong>Święte Zwierzę</strong> leafcutter ant</p><p><strong>Święte Barwy</strong> green, red</p>"

Her communications are veiled in conditional language and oddly juxtaposed statements to an almost infuriating degree, and thus she never communicates the prophetic truths she sees — so plain to her six eyes — in a straightforward way. Because of their shared knowledge of branching timelines, Shyka and Magdh can communicate more easily with each other about such topics, though the other Eldest are cautious around Magdh, lest a careless comment or errant gesture cause her to predict apocalyptic dooms.</p><p><strong>Tytuł</strong> The Three</p><p><strong>Obszary Wpływów</strong> Complexity, fate, triplets</p><p><strong>Edykty</strong></p><ul><li>Use magic to read the future and understand fate</li></ul><p><strong>Anatemy</strong></p><ul><li>Lie</li><li>Share your magic readings without payment (no matter how trivial)</li></ul>"

He wants them to know that there's no shame in learning a lesson borne from failure, but rather great pride in true humility and in being able to work past the ego to instead find humor in all the silly stages of life.</p><p>A common saying is that \"a Ragdyan tries anything at least once, and gladly tells you the story of how it went wrong at least twice.\" For his many rural followers, being a Ragdyan means being open to expanding their horizons when the chance arrives, even if they're unable to go out and adventure themselves. The church of the mountain sage can be found in a plethora of places, from grandstanding, intricate temples to small shrines in remote villages, to the corners of restaurants in big cities and to prominently placed altars in taverns, where people from all over can come together and exchange tales of their lives. No matter the location, there will always be a depiction of Bahmenu with the Sage sitting atop it, hoping for the faithful to bless the shrines with the sound of laughter. Groups of traveling Ragdyan devotees go from inn to inn and put on shows filled with humorous anecdotes and the most ridiculous experiences the cast has ever had, working with the audience to bring forth riches of both coin and joy.</p><p><strong>Tytuł</strong> The Sage on the Mountain</p><p><strong>Obszary Wpływów</strong> Humor, lessons, monkeys</p><p><strong>Edykty</strong></p><ul><li>Create humor in life</li><li>Seek enlightenment through worldly experience</li><li>Use harmless pranks to teach others</li></ul><p><strong>Anatemy</strong></p><ul><li>Discriminate based on social status</li><li>Make a joke out someone's suffering</li><li>Take control of another's life and agency</li></ul>"

This text dictates how his priests ascend within the hierarchy of his church, and the specific details of these steps can only be learned by first joining his priesthood.

Following his ascension, Razmir made his way to the Archduchy of Melcat, where his feats of incredible magic power, promises of wealth, and teachings regarding the secret to following in his footsteps caused many to flock to his banner and holy word. Razmir founded his first temple in the Melcatian city of Xer, where he began elevating masked priests to serve him and teaching the doctrine of the 31 Steps. Razmir then annihilated the Duke of Melcat and all his followers for heresy with a potent act of magic, making evidence of his godhood plain for all to see. Razmir's faith and earthly dominion spread quickly through the River Kingdoms after this, though his reign has been plagued by fools who continue the heresies of Duke Melcat.

The empyreal lord Rowdrosh is to animals what Bergelmir is to people — a guide and caretaker who binds members of a community together with common goals and feelings of kinship. It was Rowdrosh who convinced the first animals to join in groups bound not just by survival, but by companionship. Rowdrosh lived among the packs and herds, eventually settling among a herd of sheep and partially adopting their form. He was the first to domesticate an animal, and with patience and his blessing, countless people have followed in his footsteps since, taming dogs, oxen, sheep, mammoths, and far wilder creatures throughout the ages. Rowdrosh teaches people to watch over those in their charge — whether a literal herd or members of a following — and to treat animals with the kindness, care, and patience they would afford their own kin.

The life force of the land serves as the source of Shoanti power and insight, rather than the otherworldly spiritual essence of the Great Beyond common to clerics.

Animated creatures were rare, and beyond the wind through the boughs, little moved. Then Shumunue came to establish the Court of Transcendence. In her grotto, she taught the flowers and leaves to mimic praying mantises, bees, and moths. Then came herds of wooden deer, cranes, bats, and more, all delicately carved and polished. Within their minds, Shumunue imparted to these creatures the blueprints for their species and the instinct to carve their own descendants.

For the Crimson Reclaimers, this means never forgetting the pain and trauma caused by the Whispering Tyrant in Lastwall, and channeling that grief into fuel for righteous revenge. Beyond these two major divine influences, three other deities represent values the followers of the pantheon hold dear. Gorum (Our Lord in Iron) preaches strength and victory in battle. Iomedae (The Inheritor) led the charge on many successful attacks against Tar-Baphon, so it's only natural that her legendary deeds, and sense of honor, justice, and valor speak to followers of Sorrow's Sword. Many consider Arazni (The Unyielding) to be a strong part of this pantheon, due to her edict to survive at all costs and her abhorrence for the creation of unwilling undead. Arazni's inclusion is complicated by Vildeis and Ragathiel's feelings about evil, which is why Arazni is not an official member of the pantheon among all followers.</p><p><strong>Obszary Wpływów</strong> vengeance, reclaiming lost homelands, drawing strength from sorrow</p><p><strong>Edykty</strong></p><ul><li>Avenge the wronged</li><li>Destroy evildoers</li><li>Lead the charge in battle</li><li>Remember your community's history</li></ul><p><strong>Anatemy</strong></p><ul><li>Cower from combat</li><li>Forgive those who have committed grave offenses</li><li>Abandon or deceive allies</li></ul>"

When the Worldwound opened and demons poured forth, the Stag Mother gathered many Sarkorians to safety in her demesne, a region of the Stonewilds known as the Forest of Stones. Between the Stag Mother's godly power and the might of the lesser spirit guides that gathered under her banner, the Forest of Stones may have stood as a bastion of nature capable of withstanding even the unprecedented demonic incursion, but sadly a group of druids in the region lost faith in their long-time protectors. When the horrific perversions of druidic faith known as the Stonewild Sect transformed themselves into undead, their twisted power spread through the bonds some shared with the spirit guides, killing many of the weaker guides instantly and transforming others into dark mockeries of their former selves. In despair, the Stag Mother retreated far from the front lines of the battle, sheltering a precious few. While her worship has once again begun to spread beyond her forest home, the Stag Mother's trust of her human worshippers has been deeply undermined, and she demands that the spirit guides who live within her dominion do not form bonds with mortals or accept new god callers without her express permission.</p><p><strong>Tytuł</strong> She Who Listens</p><p><strong>Obszary Wpływów</strong> Druids, motherhood, sacred nature</p><p><strong>Edykty</strong></p><ul><li>Act as a responsible steward of your environment</li><li>Provide shelter and succor for women and children in need</li></ul><p><strong>Anatemy</strong></p><ul><li>Harm a pregnant mother or innocent child, including animals</li></ul>"

You won't find a city of any size in the region that doesn't boast a sizable temple to honor his tenets of expanding civilization, promoting prosperity, and following the rule of law. This pantheon expands his focus by enjoining the kinder and more uplifting elements of urban life, shifting away from Abadar's well-known pursuit of wealth to a pursuit of peace and prosperity for everyone in the city. Worshippers of this pantheon invoke Alseta the Welcomer, who watches over city gates to keep invaders out and defenders safe, as well as Tanagaar the Aurulent Eye, who keeps a careful eye over those who protect the innocent at night. Adherents to this pantheon also look to Alseta for guidance in making their cities open and welcoming to all peaceful dwellers therein and for wisdom through the many transitions of urban life; they strive to follow her edict of treating all other beings with courtesy and respect. From Korada, they draw their inspiration in the pursuit of a peaceful mindset and public policy that enjoins harmony, using the law to support redemption. In another departure from what you'll see as a common Abadaran practice, the worshippers of this pantheon don't build opulent, flashy temples. Their shrines often skew toward the simple, as the Urban Prosperity tends to distribute any money it raises to those causes that promote peace and bring prosperity to all. Services are offered daily at dawn and dusk, typically accompanied by serene music and time for contemplation and meditation. If you find yourself in need of some tranquility, I highly recommend attending.</p><p><strong>Edykty</strong></p><ul><li>Celebrate the benefits of urban life</li><li>Find common ground and establish harmony</li><li>Protect your city from intrusion or decay</li><li>Welcome everyone</li></ul><p><strong>Anatemy</strong></p><ul><li>Betray the safety of your city</li><li>Disparage urban life</li><li>Foment animosity or contention</li><li>Refuse hospitality or aid</li><li>Move to the country</li></ul><p><strong>Obszary Wpływów</strong> peace, prosperity of cities, protection</p><p><strong>Pantheon Members</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.d56paSkcwvll2OhR]{Abadar}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.9n2CI0B3EA4y3BuU]{Alseta}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.5ZIvg8CkqRMepVcX]{Korada}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.DFxbPmQLOqcmbPTz]{Tanagaar}</p>"

Their work aims less for direct confrontation instead destroying the connections of a community through falsehoods and whisper campaigns.

Fortunately, his worship is not widespread, but some of those who have delved deep into his secrets describe him as an ambivalent figure, rather than a malevolent one, who guards cosmic secrets and makes them accessible to those who dare to ask for them. Yog-Sothoth reveals the true nature of the universe, but this is a thing that once seen cannot be unseen, and wise mortals turn aside from Yog-Sothoth's offer of cosmic knowledge in favor of a more mundane existence.</p><p><strong>Tytuł</strong> Lurker at the Threshold</p><p><strong>Obszary Wpływów</strong> Gates, space, time</p><p><strong>Edykty</strong></p><ul><li>Gather knowledge of gates through space and time</li><li>Curse or mutate unborn children</li></ul><p><strong>Anatemy</strong></p><ul><li>None</li></ul>"
