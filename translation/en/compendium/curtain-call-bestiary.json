Other devils often view their Risk Aura as a hindrance, so they usually receive less important missions.

Old gamblers' yarns warn to watch the footsteps of fellow gamblers and be wary of those whose tread seems disproportionate to their size, though in truth, all but the most careless gambling devils know how to step lightly in their humanoid forms.</p>",

Instead, girtablilus exclusively revere and protect sites dedicated to deities considered lost to civilization. In this way, they act as preservers of holy practices that have otherwise been forgotten beneath the desert's shifting sands.</p>\n<p>Though girtablilus are used to explorers seeking entrance to the sites they defend, they might welcome those who earnestly wish to learn or offer reverence.

Ghlaunder worshippers often do so to create powerful guardians for their hidden temples; furnericos created in this manner instinctively treat worshippers of Ghlaunder as allies... a trait not shared by those born from a prior furnerico, and a lesson many Ghlaunder cultists only learn moments before their death after assuming otherwise from a furnerico found in the wild.</p>",

Regardless, the typical brine dragon has little patience for kindness or philanthropy, and the strength and health of their settlement as a whole are of greater concern than individuals' well-being. A notable exception to this dispassion rises when an outside force encroaches on their lands. In these cases, the brine dragon is quick to step in and aid in the defense of their community.</p>\n<p>Although brine dragons enjoy cultivating settlements, they rarely make their lairs within the city limits, instead preferring to dwell in sea caves or cliffside grottoes overlooking the coastline.

This is simply another form of camouflage, one that allows them to blend into cities, much as their stripes allow them to fade into jungles, and it often lulls scholars and intellectuals into a false sense of security.

They are fated to serve solely as foils to others, to corrupt the unworthy and fall to the heroic, never free to forge their own path. They are condemned to perform the most heinous of deeds, even if it rankles their sensibilities and conscience.

In most cases, these fragments simply disperse on their own, but when dreamers flee from nightmares back to the waking world, these fragments can take on a supernatural life of their own. They have little reasoning and intent except to seek similar fragments, absorb them, and grow. When enough of them gather together, they merge into a horrific form as an animate dream.</p>\n<p>Individually, animate dreams can hold a wide range of appearances, but most take on rudimentary shapes akin to the living forms of the minds that spawned them. Animate dreams that rise from slumbering humanoids, the most commonly encountered, thus appear humanoid, but with distorted, nightmarish shapes that incorporate additional twisted limbs and frightening features. In these forms, animate dreams find their way out of the Dreamlands and into the waking world, only to discover they have no way of returning and suffer a relentless hunger that only new nightmares can sate.</p>\n<p>An animate dream thrives on the terror fueled by nightmares and fear and uses its supernatural abilities to invoke such feelings in the minds of its victims, cursing its prey by creating a permanent link to that individual's dreams. Thereafter, the victim is subjected to all manner of reoccurring nightmares. As the nightmares continue, the victim finds it more and more difficult to remain awake. In the end, the victim plunges into an accursed slumber from which it cannot return. These victims provide the animate dream with the purest form of fear and are its preferred sustenance.</p>\n<p>An animate dream can subsist on the ambient fear generated by regular nightmares, but these lesser fears aren't as satisfying, often driving the animate dream to seek out new victims. Left without a source of fear, an animate dream won't starve to death, but it will grow increasingly violent and desperate. Famished animate dreams are the ones most often encountered, as they have been forced to abandon subtlety to pursue more blatant methods of harvesting fear. Yet such animate dreams also tend to be the least powerful of their kind. Those who have grown metaphysically fat on fear have generally done so by adopting a specific nightmare theme, such as being buried alive, being swept away by ocean waves, or being consumed by wild beasts. Such animate dreams often have similarly themed innate spells to augment their powers.</p>",

A mask's statistics don't change if it's a Small creature, and they gain increased space and reach if they're Large or larger. Change ancestry traits as needed, but Speed and languages are unchanged. All masks of Norgorber possess darkvision granted them by their deity. Whether or not you grant a mask additional ancestry-based abilities is left to you to decide.</p>\n<h2>Masks and the Afterlife</h2>\n<p>When a worshipper becomes a mask, they technically die and travel to the Boneyard to be judged by Pharasma, but in this case, the process is almost instantaneous. When Norgorber chooses someone to become a mask, a swift and nearly instantaneous blurring of the creature is the only indication of their change. Like most fiends, masks are immortal unless slain through violence or misadventure. Once slain, a mask's body decays as normal, and after a variable amount of time has passed, their soul returns to the Great Beyond to accrete its quintessence into Norgorber's realm of Duskfathom.</p>",

At first glance, a skull peeler looks like a cuddly pet or a wizard's familiar. Any illusions of domesticating such a beast are quickly dismissed upon seeing how a skull peeler eats, however.</p>\n<p>Skull peelers have evolved to hang motionlessly in treetop canopies as they wait until appropriate prey appears, usually long-necked dinosaurs but also brachiating primates and large birds. The skull peeler then lashes out with its long tongue, severing the creature's head from its body and pulling the detached cranium back into its hungry paws. It then uses its claws to crack open the cranial cavity-hence its name-before lapping up the tasty insides.</p>\n<p>Despite skull peelers' gruesome eating habits, some enterprises and individuals can't resist the urge to add these beasts to their menageries. Fey and other creatures with ties to the First World, such as gnomes, can occasionally coax a skull peeler into a form of domestication. While the adorable beasts can never be fully tamed due to their hyper-evolved hunting instincts, they can be bribed with food and, if kept satiated, displayed on a perch or indoor terrarium as an example of their master's cunning and deadliness. As often as not, these pseudo-domesticated skull peelers end up devouring a guest, pet, or their would-be owner, but this possibility doesn't stop up-and-coming crime lords from attempting to domesticate the little predators. Skull peelers kept in well-managed zoos fare somewhat better, but these clever creatures don't always stay in their cages, which has led to wild skull peelers in places travelers might not expect.</p>",

They assume titles that allow them maximum freedom to punish or hurt others with minimal oversight: any vindictive guard captain, tyrannical viceroy, or needlessly cruel magistrate could be or become a palace skelm. They delight in the wealth and status of their positions, garbing themselves in ornate finery that reflects their station.</p>\n<p>Palace skelms ingratiate themselves with powerful individuals and gather followers by stoking fears of losing long-held or hard-earned power-especially power gained through illicit means. They undermine their enemies by encouraging competition, jealousy, and outright paranoia by way of magic and false messages. These skelms possess an unnatural ability to twist spoken words and worm their manipulative magic into others' speech, sowing confusion and hatred that might explode into violence.</p>\n<p>A political upheaval is a palace skelm's greatest fear and opportunity alike, upsetting the balance of power he has built but providing countless new opportunities to sow hatred and evil. This conflicting goal leads palace skelms to self-sabotage and undermine their own efforts more than any other skelm.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Rage-filled skelms are drawn to any settlement with more than a few hundred souls. Using magical disguises and leveraging societal norms to their benefit, these antlered monsters crave fearful respect and brutally punish any who dare disagree with their lofty opinions, even in the slightest degree. Although quite dangerous on their own, skelms are at their deadliest when leading an angry mob. Their cruel and exploitative nature has made their name synonymous with villainy.</p>\n<p>An existing skelm can transform any evil humanoid who's overwhelmed with rage into one of their kind. Skelms heap enraging humiliation on potential new brothers as a form of indoctrination, convincing these recruits that some other person or group is responsible for their misery. This practice ensures skelms begin their new existence with sufficient vitriol to plot their revenge.</p>\n<p>Many newly forged skelms carry on their lives in the roles they held as mortals; and in fact, these roles often shape the type of skelm they become. Skelms can arise among members of nearly any ancestry, though they're more common among cultures with deeply entrenched gender roles, unjust hierarchies, and those that don't offer healthy ways to experience and process anger.</p>",

These capricious fey have humanoid torsos and seagull heads, wings, and feet, and they stand about 5 feet tall. Consummate performers, shanty chanters adore music, especially the sea shanties sung by ships' crews. The songs from these fey's aeries can be heard from miles away over the open sea. While some sailors claim these songs intentionally lure mortals to drown, most shanty chanters aren't outright malevolent and would be more inclined to investigate a foundering ship than to slaughter those aboard, even if they do relieve such a vessel of its valuables.</p>\n<p>Shanty chanters have a particular affinity for pirate ships, and a captain who wins an alliance with an aerie of shanty chanters is considered blessed with good luck. Of course, this attention can be a double-edged sword. If a captain fails to appease the ship's allied shanty chanters (generally by giving them a fair share of the plunder gained while they're on board), the affronted fey afflicts the captain with a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.z2mfh3oPnfYqXflY]{Mariner's Curse} before departing for more prosperous shores.</p>\n<h2>Chanter Vanity</h2>\n<p>Shanty chanters are quite vain, adorning themselves in jewelry obtained in the raids of their allied ships or taken in raids of their own. They appreciate flattery toward both their physical appearances and musical talents, and they view this type of bribe to be as valuable as material goods. Conversely, the surest way to gain a shanty chanter's enmity is to insult their singing, and only the deeply unwise would dare such a thing.</p>",

Most waxen effigies arise from botched rituals intended to migrate a powerful sapient creature's soul into a body made of wax, whether in a bid for immortality or a method of imprisonment or sacrifice. The deathâ€”especially a traumatic deathâ€”of a sapient creature in close proximity to a wax figure or while attempting to craft a construct out of wax might also result in a waxen effigy.</p>\n<p>A waxen effigy looks like a partially melted wax version of who it appeared as in life. They retain little of their former personality but recall a jumble of memories from their mortal existence that serves only to anger them. They often cling to objects that were important to them in life, such as a spouse's wedding band or a tool from a favorite hobby. Displaying such an object to a waxen effigy transfixes their attention, though they often lash out if the object is taken away before they can be laid to rest.</p>\n<h2>Cruel Creations</h2>\n<p>Few set out to create a waxen effigy on purpose, as their fragmented memories cause them to behave rather erratically, and as such, they make poor guardians or assassins. Any intentional creation of a waxen effigy is solely an act of spite since it condemns the soul to an undeath steeped in bewilderment and fear.</p>",
